// should zoom the PAGE (Safari/mobile-Chrome semantics) instead of the harness treating it as two
// ordinary clicks. Read-only: no event dispatched, no session/frame mutated, safe to call from the
// tap-hold path before deciding whether to actually click.
// The rules, in the order they are applied (0.1.9.39, rule 1 made symmetric in 0.1.9.50):
//   1. Current page scale more than 5 % away from 1:1 IN EITHER DIRECTION — the harness' own
//      pinch zoom — always wins: zoomable=1, target 1.0, whatever the page says. A double tap
//      must always be able to undo a pinch, or an opted-out page traps the user at the scale the
//      pinch left behind. Both directions, because this harness commits page scales below 1:1
//      too (the pinch-out overview, down to 0.5); until 0.1.9.50 the test was scale > 1.05 and a
//      double tap on a page the user had zoomed OUT fell through to rules 2-5 and was refused.
//   2. Page opted out of zooming altogether (viewport meta user-scalable=no, or
//      minimum-scale == maximum-scale): not zoomable.
//   3. Page is mobile-optimised (viewport meta with width=device-width, or width unset with
//      initial-scale=1) — Blink's WebViewImpl::ShouldDisableDesktopWorkarounds(): not zoomable.
//      This is what makes taps immediate on every well-behaved mobile site, because the harness
//      only pays the double-tap hold interval where a zoom could actually happen.
//   4. CSS touch-action other than auto on the hit element or an ancestor: not zoomable
//      (mirrors WebKit's own Element::allowsDoubleTapGesture(), compiled out on this port
//      since ENABLE_TOUCH_EVENTS=0).
//   5. Otherwise zoomable, at the target below.
//   *outZoomable: 1 if double-tap-to-zoom applies here, 0 otherwise (including no session and
//     no hit, and including a target that would not move the page, see below).
//   *outTargetScale: the scale a double tap here should animate to, clamped to the driver's own
//     [1.25, 3.0] double-tap range (a subrange of WebCoreSetPageScale's [0.5, 6.0]): 1.0 in
//     case 1 above; otherwise viewport-width / (width of the innermost block-level ancestor of
//     the hit point narrower than 90 % of the layout viewport — Safari's "zoom to column"
//     heuristic), or 2.0 when no such ancestor exists. A block from 90 % of the viewport upwards
//     is the page's own full-width layout, not a column: zooming to it is a no-op.
//     A target within ±5 % of the current scale is never returned - it is reported as
//     zoomable=0 instead, so the caller forwards a clickCount=2 click rather than animating
//     to where it already is.
//   *outAnchorX/*outAnchorY: the anchor for that zoom, in the same viewport/bitmap px
//     WebCoreSetPageScale takes as focalX/focalY. *outAnchorY is always y (the tap y): vertically
//     the tapped point stays under the finger. *outAnchorX is x (the tap x) UNLESS the target
//     scale came from the "zoom to column" case above, in which case it is the column's own
//     horizontal centre (0.1.9.40) — Safari centres a narrower column instead of anchoring on
//     wherever inside it was tapped, so a tap near a column's edge does not zoom in with most of
//     the column off-screen. The caller does not have to remember the tap point across the hold
//     interval either way.
//     In the zoomed-OUT half of rule 1 (0.1.9.51) *outAnchorX is instead the anchor that makes the
//     zoom back to 1:1 END on the scroll position the commit will settle on — the document's own
//     left edge (0) at the usual overview position, so the content simply grows to the right until
//     it fills the screen instead of growing around the tap point and then sliding sideways once
//     WebCoreSetPageScale clamps the position it was asked for. A tap that needs no clamping (a
//     page still wider than the viewport at 1:1) keeps the tap x. *outAnchorY is the tap y here
//     too: zooming back UP can never need a vertical correction.
//   *outReason (0.1.9.40): which rule above decided the answer — 0 = zoomable (target computed),
//     1 = zoomed IN (rule 1), 7 = zoomed OUT (rule 1's other half, 0.1.9.50), 2 = no element under
//     the point, 3 = viewport disables zoom (rule 2), 4 = mobile-optimised viewport (rule 3),
//     5 = touch-action opt-out (rule 4), 6 = target within 5% of the current scale (not worth
//     animating). Left at -1 on a negative (error) return — no session/busy/no document, not a
//     rule decision.
// Any output pointer may be null. Returns kOK, or a negative error (no session prints
// outZoomable=0 as well, so a caller that only checks *outZoomable still degrades safely).

// the layout viewport all move), the scroll position re-clamped against the document the relayout
// produced, the link table re-extracted, and one composite so the caller has a correct frame - and
// forces the next composite to re-raster the whole tree, because every tile was painted for the

// page zoom and not text autosizing, both of which only enlarge a layout that is still a wide one.

# Changelog

Notable changes to the port layer, the UWP harness and the WebKit patch set.
Version numbers are the packaging counter the work was tested under on a
Lumia 950 (Windows 10 Mobile 15254.603); the app manifest carries the
project's own version.

## 0.1.9.48 (2026-09-10) — TileGrid v2 and mobile interaction

### Engine and tiling

- The tile bookkeeping in `TextureMapperTiledBackingStore` is rebuilt as
  **TileGrid v2**: a pure model plus a thin WebCore adapter.
- Every pass derives the desired tile set from layer bounds, scale, visible
  rect and budget and reconciles the grid to it; nothing survives by accident.
- A tile is addressed by `(column, row)` on a lattice anchored at the layer
  origin, so a clamp or a rounding can no longer produce a second grid.
- There are no grace counters and no timeouts: a raster or upload request is
  served in priority order or fails explicitly, and a failure is an event.
- Holes are counted over the desired cells, so the driver asks for one more
  present instead of dirtying the layer tree.
- `tests/tilegrid/` builds the real model and core sources against fake
  backends — no WebKit build, no ANGLE, no device — and runs the design
  invariants, scripted scenarios, a fuzzer and replays of captured device
  traces: 2.5 million checks in well under a minute.
- `docs/TILEGRID-DESIGN.md` is the design document that the sources and the
  tests cite by section number.
- The previous tile management is gone with it: `TextureMapperTile` is
  byte-identical to the tag again and `TextureMapperTiledBackingStore` is back
  to upstream plus about forty lines of viewport-limited 1024-pixel tiling.
- An off-screen layer store no longer keeps raster work alive for ever.

### Rendering correctness

- `Cairo::OperationRecorder::applyDeviceScaleFactor()` is an empty override, so
  a recorded tile paint was translated but never scaled. Both recording call
  sites scale explicitly now — this was the cause of every white or misplaced
  pixel while zoomed since rasterisation moved off the engine thread.
- Sticky and fixed elements get a compositing layer
  (`AcceleratedCompositingForFixedPosition` was never enabled), instead of
  being repainted into the scrolling layer on every frame.
- `ImageBackingStore::create()` returns null when its pixel reservation fails.
  It used to hand back a live store with an empty buffer, and a large photo
  then made the JPEG decoder write a scanline to a null address.
- A failed asynchronous decode notifies its waiting clients instead of leaving
  a white box, and an already decoded image is drawn rather than decoded again
  at a new scale.
- The software present blits each frame at the viewport the engine actually
  rendered it at, not at the viewport the harness currently wants. A frame in
  flight across a viewport change was read at the new, larger rectangle out of
  a buffer allocated for the old one, which walked past the end of the block
  into reserved address space and killed the app.
- Text: glyphs no longer rasterise with subpixel antialiasing and the synthetic
  bold offset walks in device-pixel steps, which removes the doubled text after
  a pinch when only the regular font cuts are installed.
- The package carries fallback faces for the characters the eight Latin cuts do
  not have: Simplified Chinese, the symbol blocks (arrows, check marks,
  technical and miscellaneous symbols) and emoji as monochrome outlines. They
  are Noto under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, fetched by `port/fetch-fonts.ps1`
  against pinned URLs and SHA-256 hashes, and the generated `fonts.conf` orders
  them after the Latin faces so a missing glyph is filled instead of drawn as a
  box. The fontconfig cache is stamped with the font set it was built for and
  dropped when that changes.
- A character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane is no longer followed by an
  empty box. The simple text path appends a placeholder glyph after every
  surrogate pair for a shaping routine to remove again; this port has none, and
  glyph 0 is the font's `.notdef`, so emoji, plane-2 ideographs and mathematical
  alphanumerics each drew a box flush against them.

### Performance

- Tile rasterisation runs off the engine thread by default: a paint is recorded
  into a display list and replayed by a worker pool. Measured on the device,
  2.9 ms instead of 25 ms of engine-thread time per scroll tick.
- Tile uploads have a per-composite time budget, and a deferred upload
  schedules the composite that lands it.
- The baseline JIT is actually enabled on ARMv7 (`APOTHEOSIS_JIT`), including
  the `replaceWithJump` displacement fix that used to corrupt the JIT pool.
  Animation-heavy pages got 20 to 30 percent faster.
- Networking: HTTP/2 multiplexing, 32 connections, eight parallel loads per
  host, deferred transfers paused instead of cancelled, DNS prefetch for
  `preconnect` hints. Time to commit on a news site went from 14.8 s to 0.4 s.
- Three loader defects came out of that work: a cancelled `ResourceHandle` left
  a dangling client, every finished load leaked handle, delegate, request and
  response, and a paused redirect was never cancelled on the terminal paths.
- WTF threads get a stack reservation per thread type (JavaScript 8 MB, the
  rest 1 MB). The inherited 16 MB default exhausted the 32-bit address space on
  a page with many workers and aborted in `WTF::Thread::create`.
- Memory: the JavaScript heap is sized from the application's own cap, UWP
  memory pressure reaches WebCore, and the texture pool is accounted and
  bounded.
- Page load: images below the fold are loaded lazily, DOM timers are aligned
  onto a coarse grid while a load owns the engine thread, and a navigation
  settles on the viewport instead of on trailing beacons.

### Interaction

- **Page width**: the engine lays a page out at a phone-sized CSS viewport
  instead of a tablet-sized one. The panel is 360 DIP wide and the engine runs
  at two engine pixels per DIP, so WebKit was handed a 720 CSS pixel layout
  viewport at device scale factor 1 - every site answered with its wide layout
  and 16 pixel text came out half the height it has in any phone browser. The
  factor is WebKit's device scale factor, so the layout narrows while tiles
  still rasterise at the full engine resolution and text stays sharp. Settings
  offers five steps from 1.0x (720 px) to 2.0x (360 px); the default is 1.5x,
  i.e. 480 CSS px. Changing it re-lays the page out without a reload. Every
  coordinate crossing the driver's C ABI is still in engine pixels - the
  conversion happens inside the driver.
- **Double-tap zoom** with the tap policy a mobile browser is expected to have:
  a page that opts out of zooming or declares itself mobile-optimised is not
  zoomable, a pinch is always undoable, and the target is the innermost block
  under the finger, anchored on that block's centre.
- **Double tap returns to 1:1 from either direction**: the undo-a-pinch rule
  measures the distance from 1:1 instead of only the scale above it, so a page
  the user pinched out below 1:1 is brought back by a double tap as well. From
  below 1:1 the content grows to the right from its own left edge, where the
  committed frame lands, instead of growing around the tap and sliding back.
- **Long press on a link** opens a context menu with one action, open in new
  tab. The card is placed clear of the finger, shows a long target that can be
  dragged sideways, and is dismissed by a rotation or a window change.
- **Landscape**: `WebCoreResize` gives the engine a viewport it can change, the
  ANGLE window surface follows the panel instead of being created at a fixed
  size, and the built-in start and error pages are re-rendered on a rotation.
- **Keyboard**: the focused field is brought above the on-screen keyboard —
  on the first tap after a load and after a rotation as well — and the chrome
  is inset by the rectangle the input pane really occludes.
- Panning has an axis lock, a pinch is anchored on the finger and snaps back to
  1:1, nested scrollers are found through open shadow roots, and a pan over a
  map or canvas widget is delivered as pointer events.
- Address bar: the text is selected on focus, Enter hides the keyboard, a
  tapped suggestion navigates exactly like Enter, and the text area spans the
  whole field.
- The loading strip and the page title row are overlays: neither displaces the
  page nor costs a relayout when it appears.
- A tab switch shows the target tab's last frame while it reloads.

### Start page

- The built-in start page is BUILT for the viewport and the language it is
  shown at, every time it is shown, instead of being rendered once and replayed:
  the page at app start, the page a new tab gets and the page after a rotation
  or a language change are the same page.
- A language change reaches it as well. Before, the page that was on screen when
  the first-run language choice was made kept the language it was built with -
  and with no CJK face in the package, Chinese strings on an engine-rendered
  page are empty boxes.
- The speed-dial grid is exactly two columns in portrait and four in landscape.
  The auto-fill rule it replaces was written for a 360 px CSS viewport and fitted
  four postage stamps across a portrait screen.

### Settings and cleanup

- Every user-visible string goes through the language table, and the language
  can be chosen in Settings.
- Privacy defaults: the update check is opt-in, DuckDuckGo is the default search
  engine, speculation-rules prefetch is off, and `<a ping>` is never sent.
  DuckDuckGo replaces Qwant as the fresh-install default — both state that they
  do not track or profile their users, but Qwant's results page is one of the
  pages this engine cannot get past a bot check (see Known limitations), so a
  search ended on a white page. Qwant is still in the list, and a settings file
  that already names an engine keeps it: the indices are part of the stored
  settings and are never renumbered.
- The developer switches that carried features through bring-up — the two tile
  grids, off-thread rasterisation, the presenter thread, stale placeholders,
  event-driven present — are deleted now that the features are proven; axis
  lock moved to its own Scrolling section.
- The presenter thread is gone: ANGLE 2.1.13 on D3D11 cannot be driven from two
  GL threads, and serialising every call behind one lock removed its advantage.

### Networking and cookies

- The engine ships the Public Suffix List, so it can tell a registry apart from
  a site. Without it `PublicSuffixStore` answered "no top-private domain" and
  `RegistrableDomain` fell back to the whole host name, which made every host
  its own site: the cookie jar's accept policy then refused a cookie that one
  subdomain sets for another, and the read path — which filters by registrable
  domain too — would not have sent it either. Anything that signs in, keeps a
  session or clears a bot check on one host and uses it on a sibling host was
  silently broken, while plain first-party cookies worked, so it looked like a
  rendering fault rather than a cookie one. The list is fetched by
  `port/fetch-publicsuffix.ps1` (pinned and hash-checked, internationalised
  rules punycoded at fetch time) and handed to the engine as a blob, like the
  CA bundle; without the file the engine falls back to a last-two-labels guess
  instead of the whole host.
- A navigation whose transport never came up is retried once. The curl backend
  has no retry of its own, so a single failed name lookup or TLS handshake —
  routine on a phone's Wi-Fi, and in the device logs always the first contact
  with a host in an app session — went straight to the error page, while the
  same address typed again loaded normally. Only a main-frame provisional
  failure counts (a failed subresource must never restart a page), only the
  codes that mean the connection never happened (6, 7, 28, 35, 56 — never a
  certificate rejection), and only when the first attempt gave up in under
  eight seconds, so a slow link is not made to wait twice. Each retry writes
  one `netretry` line naming the host, the code and the resolve mode.

### Known limitations

- Sites behind a commercial bot-protection service can be unreachable. The
  cookie half is fixed (see the Public Suffix List above), but the script these
  services run also fingerprints the browser, and this port compiles out most
  of what it looks for — Web Audio, WebRTC, WebAssembly, gamepads, WebGL — so
  the score is refused, the document comes back as a challenge, and the
  challenge frame itself does not render here. The page is then a white
  full-viewport overlay above content that loaded correctly underneath; the
  render diagnostic's opaque-cover field is what identifies it.

### Diagnostics

- Opt-in `perf.csv` columns and `stage.txt` trace families cover loads,
  scrolling, tiles, gestures and the keyboard, `crash.txt` records the aborts an
  App Container leaves no dump for, and everything stays off without its file.
- The render diagnostic answers "is this page blank?" again. Its non-white pixel
  count came from the software readback, which the direct GPU present does not
  do, so it read zero for every page; it is now taken once per document from a
  quarter-size probe paint. The same line carries a short content summary of the
  finished document — element, link, box and text-length counts, laid-out height
  and the body colours — in counts and lengths only, never page text or a query.
  It also reports how many in-view elements are transparent or hidden, the
  mount point's own first three levels, how many full-viewport opaque elements
  sit outside it (which is how a third-party interstitial covers a page that
  rendered correctly underneath), and how many cookies the document can see —
  again as counts and lengths, never a name or a value.

### Build and packaging

- `port/build-harness.ps1` takes the engine and driver directories as
  parameters, for the XAML code generation pass as well, so the two-Visual-Studio
  pipeline no longer depends on one fixed build directory name.
- The host tests look for a WebKit checkout beside the repository instead of an
  absolute path, and say so when there is none.
- `nghttp2.dll` and the bold font cuts are packaged with the application.
- `.gitattributes` keeps `wk-winuwp.patch` out of the CRLF conversion, so the
  file a checkout produces is byte-for-byte the one `git diff` wrote.
- `wk-winuwp.patch` is regenerated from the whole patched tree, and
  `WK_WINUWP-PATCH.md` groups every commit over the base tag by area.
